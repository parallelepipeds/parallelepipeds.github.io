  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I'm a rising senior at <b><a class ="intro"; href = https://scrippscollege.edu/about>Scripps College</a></b> pursuing a <b><a class="intro"; href=https://www.cs.hmc.edu/off-campus-students> computer science and mathematics major through Harvey Mudd College.</a></b></p> 
  <p>My current research interests lie in the embedding of human values and policy–especially pertaining to AI ethics and privacy–into technical systems.</p>
  <p>This fall, I’m on a gap semester doing data science work at the <b><a class="intro"; href = https://www.census.gov>U.S. Census Bureau</a></b> by way of a <b><a class="intro"; href=https://www.codingitforward.com/civic-digital-fellowship>Civic Digital Fellowship</a></b>.</p>
  <p>Last summer, I was part of the inaugural cohort of <b><a class="intro"; href=https://desfontain.es/privacy/privacy-engineer.html>privacy engineer</a></b> interns at <b><a class="intro"; href=https://about.google>Google</a></b>, where I participated in privacy reviews for home devices and <a class="intro"; href=https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/privacy-on-beam#4> wrote code to achieve (ε,0)-differential privacy for Privacy on Beam when partitions are specified beforehand and Laplace noise is used.</a></p>
  <p>I'm also fortunate to have been advised by <a class="intro"; href=https://pavelnaumov.com>Pavel Naumov</a>, <a class="intro"; href=https://cs.hmc.edu/~montanez>George Montañez</a>, and <a class="intro"; href=https://cs.hmc.edu/~xanda>Xanda Schofield</a> on research and independent study projects.</p>
